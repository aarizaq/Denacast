OverSim - A Flexible Overlay Network Simulation Framework

OverSim is an open-source overlay network simulation framework for the
OMNeT++/OMNEST simulation environment. The simulator contains several
models for structured (e.g. Chord) and unstructured (e.g. GIA)
peer-to-peer protocols. OverSim is developed at the
Karlsruhe Institut of Technology (KIT), Institute of Telematics.

Please look into the doc/ subdirectory where you'll find installation
instructions, the license and the API documentation.

If you need help, please visit the project website: http://www.oversim.org/

Disclaimer: OverSim is continuously being improved: new parts
are added, bugs are corrected, and so on. We cannot assert that any protocol
implemented here will work fully according to the specifications. YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE YOURSELF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MODELS YOU USE IN YOUR SIMULATIONS
WORK CORRECTLY, AND YOU'RE GETTING VALID RESULTS.

INETMANET-2.0 version, Notes
The directory of Oversim must be in the same directory that the inetmanet directory.

-inetmanet-2.0
*
-OverSim


The Inetmanet version uses Uint128 for store the Keys, this avoid the use of gmp library, but limits the key size to 128 bits
If you need bigger keys you can use the gmp library if you include "#define USEGMP" in the file OverlayKey.h

The files simulations/nodes_3d.xml, simulations/nodes_2d.xml and simulations/nodes_2d_15000.xml have been removed due to the size of the files, you must donwload the files from the OverSim site.
The doc directory has been removed, if you need the information containing in this directory you must donwload from the OverSim site.
